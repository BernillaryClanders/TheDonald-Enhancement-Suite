# TheDonald Enhancement Suite

The purpose of this project is to create a plugin which provides UI customization for TheDonald.win. This will be an evolving project, subject to change at any given moment.

**Important:** I do not wish to receive any donations or compensation for the project -- now or ever. Donate to TheDonald.win (if they choose to accept donations) or contribute to the reelection of Donald J Trump! - [donaldjtrump.com](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)
